This directory contains planning documents for integrating the `frontend-temp` folder into the main project. These documents outline the strategy, specific tasks, component mapping, and risk mitigation approaches for the integration process.

## Document Index

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Integration Plan](./integration-plan.md) | High-level overview of the integration strategy and approach |
| [Action Items](./action-items.md) | Detailed checklist of specific tasks for each integration step |
| [Component Mapping](./component-mapping.md) | Mapping of components between projects and their new locations |

## Integration Overview

The goal is to integrate the sports betting UI from `frontend-temp` into the existing Next.js application that includes authentication, database, and payment features. The integration will:

1. Preserve the existing authentication and user management
2. Incorporate the sports betting UI components and routes
3. Maintain consistent styling and user experience
4. Ensure all features remain functional after integration

## Implementation Phases

The integration will follow these phases:

1. **Foundation Integration**: Set up configuration and folder structure
2. **Core UI Migration**: Move non-interactive components and establish styling
3. **Interactive Component Migration**: Integrate data services and interactive components
4. **Route Integration**: Set up route structure and navigation
5. **Testing & Refinement**: Comprehensive testing and optimization

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve the integration plan
2. Set up initial folder structure and configurations
3. Begin the component migration process
4. Implement route structure
5. Test and refine the integrated application
