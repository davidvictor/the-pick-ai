  - Terrence Shannon Jr. (Grade 2 mid-foot sprain; 2-4 weeks)  
  - Donte DiVincenzo (left toe surgery; indefinite)  
  - Jesse Edwards (undisclosed; two-way contract)  
- **Questionable**:

**${game.homeTeam.name}**  
- **Questionable**:  
  - Kevin Durant (right thumb sprain; participated in shootaround)  
  - Ryan Dunn (left ankle sprain; limited practice)  

---

### **Late-Scratch Watch**  
- **Kevin Durant** remains the focal point: His availability hinges on pre-game warmups. If ruled out, Bradley Beal and Grayson Allen will see expanded roles[1][34].  
- **Naz Reid**'s absence would force Minnesota to rely on Leonard Miller or Joe Ingles for bench frontcourt minutes[10][29].  

---

### **Rotation & Strategy Notes**  
- **${game.awayTeam.name}**:  
  - Coach Chris Finch confirmed starters: Mike Conley, Anthony Edwards, Jaden McDaniels, Julius Randle, Rudy Gobert[26].  
  - Perimeter defense concerns if Alexander-Walker (elite 3P% defender) is limited[4][8].  
- **${game.homeTeam.name}**:  
  - Phoenix plans to exploit Minnesota's 24th-ranked 3P defense (36.0% allowed) if Durant plays[6][9].  
  - Devin Booker (26.5 PPG last 10 games) expected to handle primary scoring load[21].  

---

### **Trends & Context**  
- **Home/Away Splits**:  
  - ${game.homeTeam.abbreviation}: 15-8 at home (+1.5 PPG differential)[6].  
  - ${game.awayTeam.abbreviation}: 13-11 on the road (4th-ranked defense)[9].  
- **Over/Under**:  
  - Suns games hit Over in 71% of contests (32/45), while Timberwolves games trend Under (52% rate)[6][9].
